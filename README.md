**Deviations**:
Join Random Group Implementation:
- The protocol / delegate is set up, but the user cannot join a random group yet. Aaron and Arisyia will implement this in the beta deliverable

Habit View Data:
- Habit data is still gathered from STUB data right now, it needs to be hooked up to the firebase in Beta.
