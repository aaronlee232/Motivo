### Names: Aaron Lee, Cooper Wilk, Arisyia Wong, John Bukoski

#### Disclaimer:  
For testing purposes, use the following email and password to show a populated connections list  
Email: test@gmail.com  
Password: 123456  

Creating account and forget password works, but the populated connections list only works for test user (test@gmail.com) since the social functionality is not fully implemented yet.

Group Invite Code: It works if user provides the group ID from Firebase. However, we still need to implement retrieving the group code inside the app.
